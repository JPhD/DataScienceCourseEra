### README

#### Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository is a **JPhD** submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It has instructions on how to clean and tidy a data set on Human Activity recognition.

#### Dataset

[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

#### Files

* `CodeBook.md` a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data

* `run_analysis.R` performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project's definition:
    - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each               measurement.
    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the        average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
* `FinalData.txt` is the exported final data after going through all the sequences          described above.
